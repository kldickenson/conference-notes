ENFJ (Myer Briggs)

### What are code review

Human evaluation of human code
Humans make mistakes
Catch mistakes in the least costly of development times
Accountability for code quality
Sharing of knowledge
Mentorship
Building trust

Code reviews more effective than standard unit testing by 30%-35%

Review code you did NOT work on
About 200-400 lines of code at a time
Limit time to one hour
Create a checklist of things to review

_Correctness_ - errors & mistakes
_Clarity/Maintainability_ - look and describe, self-documenting, naming conventions, identify and eliminate code smells
_Efficiency_ - evaluate performance impact, dBase queries, DOM manipulation, asynchronous JS calls
_Style_ - you should have style standards, naming conventions, linting, code comments

### Who should be involved?
Small groups best
Review code you are NOT familiar with

### When should reviews happen

Branch merge request
Make code reviews as part of your culture/process

### How should code review happen

Online Vs. In-Person (determined by comfort level)
Online provides record of review
In-Person provides more interaction and discussion. + Body language

_Online Tools_
Crucible (Atlassian) good for pre-PR
Upsource (Jetbrain)
Pull Requests via GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab...

The Soft Skill MATTER!

Have a code style guide!
Avoid general feedback, add specificity

_Assume positive intent_
Trust your teammates. Be respectful. Be humble.
Avoid unconscious bias

Have expectation for conduct in code reviews

_Code reviews are the EMPOWERING each other to write really great code._

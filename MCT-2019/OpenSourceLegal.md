# What You Need to Know About Open Source-Trust Me, I'm a Lawyer - Jeff Strauss @jeffreystrauss

Slides on SpeakerDeck

## OSS
- Free redistribution (freedom of speech, not "free-beer")
- Source code inclusion (code is readily, publicly visible. Not obfuscated. Original files, not compiled)
- Derived works (right to modify, and right to redistribute)
- Non-interference ()
- Non-discrimination (purpose, )


## intellectual property realm

- copyright
- patent
- ~~trademark~~

## You can sell OSS

## commercial != proprietary

## Licenses

- MIT (academic-MIT, pre-dates OSS, "AS IS" license, with attribution, pre-date patent)
- BSD (CAL-Berkley, three versions, middle clauses differ, pre-date patent)
   - 3rd clause is non-endorsement (cannot promote using original owner as endorsement),
   - 4th clause: advertising provision (must give attribution through specific phrase), Used very rarely
- apache (includes a patent license, includes poison pill over downstream user patening)
- GPL (General Public, copyleft: the GPL license carries forward)
   - GPL v3 (patent stuff, API in cloud is NOT distribution)
   - GPL v2
   - LGPL (dynamically link to service okay)
   - AGPL (even remote services are open)


## Open Source Initiative (group that overseas the OSS definition etc.)

MVP - minimum viable product
Continuous iteration on the MVP

Usage data should be your guide. It will show you how you got where you are and where you are going.

Hard data VS Soft data

_Hard:_ 
Website analytics, user metrix

_Soft:_ 
User research, you need to know your audience
Personas based on their goals for your site. Think what drives your customer.

Get the concerns from the developers and ask the customers

Whiteboard out your high-level information architecture

The lowers amount of clicks doesn't always mean it's the bet solution. With that in mind, use the fewest interactions possible.

_Whiteboard:_ 
User Flows, 
Journey maps, 
Action <-> reaction,

Competitive analysis good:
Compare your journey maps
See where you can improve
If something seems off, look deeper
Identify what they do well
Identify what they do poorly

Beware of: 
Dark Patterns,
Happy Paths

Have someone else write the user stories

Requirements are important

# Designing an Intuitive Navigation - Gerry McGovern @gerrymcgovern

__BE DIRECT!__

Do __NOT__ make promises and then throw in 5-8 steps before the promise is met.

Navigation should get you closer to your intended destination, without distractions. Rely on your users to know where they want to go. Do NOT second guess their decisions.

Be bold with location markers (section header), eliminate artifacts for other sections.

Adding more and more options muddy the experience for the user.

Be purposeful with a single structure, a unified place

## Clarity

Icons are the the __worst__ form of navigation

There are __very few__ internationalized icons causing confusion.

Always include words with your icons. They add understanding.

Labelled icons have a 88% usage understanding, unlabelled 60%, unique icons 34%.

Hamburgers are rotten!

Hidden menu to visible menu results in increase in usage.

__NAVIGATION NEEDS TO BE VISIBLE!__

ONLY TIME good for hamburger: super task (like maps). Don't hide all the navigation.

## Twins: object and subject

Phone battery draining:

* Object: Phone issue (product)
* Subject: need to call support

Toyota:

* Object: Product
* Subject: Price

Heart attacks in Canada than in France:

* Object: Health
* Subject: Country

## Minimalism (focus)

Once the user has arrived at their destination, remove everything else so the destination is the focus.

Gov.uk (even removes all higher level menus) is highly focuses!

Remove the tiny tasks!

Great links tell you what they are as well as what they are NOT!

Quick Links / Slow Links

Frequently Asked Questions / No other questions

Tools / empty tool chest

Knowledge Base / Idiot Hub

Useful Links / Useless Links

Most Popular / Shunned people

Navigation should be as invisible as possible (out of the way and stripped to the bare minimum).

## What really matters 
### Find the 35 top tasks on your site
    1. ask 15 people to sort the top 35 into groups
    1. never force them to name the group
    1. create a similarity matrix (slide 71) to help you with classification
    1. test the sort
        * orphans need to be at the top level
        * follow the evidence
        * use the group's % of total tasks to help you determine their importance
    1. Make sure to use 15-35 tasks to test. Test with multiple groups (minimum of 3 groups) of 15 people per group. (You may run into "the twins" when doing this)

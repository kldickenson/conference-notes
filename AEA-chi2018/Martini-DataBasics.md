## Data, data, everywhere

## Challenges of working with data
10. I don't have the skills or time
    * low hanging tools to use
        * Google Analytics
9. Page views & clicks aren't useful to me
    * new way: look at events
        * opening the app
        * click on a button
        * adding letters to the search box
        * scrolling through the search results
8. My service isn't just a <foo>
    * different types of data stored in different location i.e. mobile, phone orders, ext.
    * quantified journey maps (slide 35) (time spent, purchase, view ticket, photo upload)
7. I don't have many users
    * data from even a single user is useful!

6. Old data isn't useful
    * data dump (directions to a new place) vs real time (maps for traffic versus)
    * Churn - predicting gaining/loosing users
5. I don't know which questions to ask of my data
    * Start with the strategy, then collect data
    * HEART framework (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task Success)
    * Pirate
    * Strategy
        * What are your goals (from HEART)?
        * What is the signal that the goal has been reached?
        * What is the metric of the goal being reached?
    * What part of the journey path do we cant to measure and how do we collect that information?
4. How do I answer those questions?
    * look for steep changes
    * predictions
    * A/B testing with control group
        * to figure out initial user pool [Evan's Awesome A/B Tools](www.evanmiller.org/lab-testing/sample.size.html)
3. Data is not the full story
    * data (quantified) provides the "what"
    * still need the qualitative research for the "why"
    * "Is this information useful?" (Page pop-up, light weight surveys)
2. My Colleagues don't believe in data
    * "Place your bets!" (Bet on the results of the A/B)
    * Dashboard forces the team to come to agreement on what is important
1. I don't want to be a creep
    * Proceed with caution!

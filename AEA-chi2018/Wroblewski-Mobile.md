# Mobile in the Future - Luke Wroblewski

## 2007 \- intro of the iPhone

## How has own design approach changed with the advent of the mobile/smartphone?

Flat design

Feature creep

Minimum Viable Product

## Design

Add functionality/things -> Redesign -> Add things -> Redesign -> ...

A circular process 

Sometimes it looks like you have come full circle (iOS calc, Twitter)

Facebook - has about 72 different __current__ mobile menus because the menu is determined by the users usage

Scary: 10 years of mobile are doing the same design/reiteration/redesign cycle that has occurred in the PC market for the past 30 years (Adobe Illustrator)

## Login

ISSUE: not showing the password as you are typing

Iteration is awesome BUT we need some __VISION__

Think of the client's usage! Making tech to work the way that people work not people adjusting to how tech works.

## Checkout / Forms

Optimizations that can be used today:

* Input Masks (slide 50)
* Smart Default (slide 51)

__Amazon!__

* Amazon Dash button
* Amazon Go stores 
    * no checkout but feels like "stealing"
    * cameras, microphones and sensors follow you)
    * technical complexity BUT real simple for the user

## Frictionless user interactions

* Apple AirPods
* Google Home
* Snapchat Spectacles (simple recording BUT need to use the app to upload with a complex interactions to get video up.)

## Mobile - getting people to the right thing at the right time

What's your address? One tap response with "auto complete" (slide 72)

Google Translate embedded in Hangouts for on-the-fly translation (slide 73)

__TRY__ simplifying!

## Load time

Cognitive Load with stressful situation

More stressful than horror movies is waiting for mobile loading! (Slide 79)

## HAPPY HUMANS /- simplify for the user, put the complexity in the tech

## Goals for Mobile
* Immense Opportunity
* Optimize for Today
* Aim for the Future

# Beyond Engagement: the Contents Performance Quotient - Jeffrey Zeldman

## Engagement

Spending time on your site

Instagram - yes, you want engagement

Online publication - yes, you want engagement

Product/service - NO, you want them to find the content quickly, if they spend too much time, they are NOT finding what they need. You are not doing your job.

## Speed of usefulness - Content Performance Quotient (Design CPQ)

How quickly can they love us and leave us?

__CPQ__ - How quickly can you solve the customer's problem? A measurement.

The shortest distance between problem &amp; solution.

A new goal to __iterate__ against. A new way to __deliver value__. A new way to __evaluate success__.

## "Why do we need this?"

__Slash your architecture. Skrink your content.__

Every design is __intentional__.

### Solutions
* Design is the rendering of INTENT - Jared Spoul
* Responsive Design
* Mobile First

### Problem generators
* Meetings over meaning
* Content Mangement Systems - no content editorial process, you loose site of the client over getting "everything" up.

## Customer Focused Work

Harder for us, but better for the customer &amp; bottom line.

__Fight for the customer!__

The web pages that time forgot.

When you stip down the game to its core.....

Focus __relentlessly__ on the individual interaction. - Brad Frost

### FAQ problems
* Duplicate and contradictory information (duplicative dissonance)
* Lack of discernible content order
* Repetitive grammatical structure
